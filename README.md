# Netflix-Data-Visualization

In this notebook, I ran some simple algorithms to display important information on the distribution of products on Netflix.

For example, through a pie chart, I studied the distribution of films and series to see which one is more present on the platform. Again, I visualised the most common genres of films and series and also the average duration of the products.

It is really simple but effective for those that want to have a in-depth knowledge of what Netflix offers to its users.
